# Between Sessions: Domain Explorer Challenge

## Your Mission

Using the Sentiment Showdown Space (your duplicate from Session 4), go on a domain hunt.

### Challenge: Break the Models

Find a **type of text** that your comparison Space handles poorly. Ideas to try:
- Song lyrics from your favorite artist
- A paragraph from a textbook
- A recipe
- Sports commentary
- A legal disclaimer (from any app's terms of service)
- Dialogue from a video game
- Your own creative writing

### Then: Find a Better Model

Go to https://huggingface.co/models and search for a sentiment model trained on the domain where your models failed. Can you find one? If you do, try swapping it into your Space.

### Bring to Next Session
- The text that confused the models the most
- Why you think it confused them (what's different about that text?)
- Bonus: a model from the Hub that might handle it better
