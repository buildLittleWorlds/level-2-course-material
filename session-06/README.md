# Session 6: Same Space, Different Worlds

## No New Space This Session

This session reuses the **Sentiment Showdown** Space from Session 4 (`session-04/`). There is no `app.py` or `requirements.txt` in this directory.

Students feed the Session 4 comparison Space text from wildly different domains to discover that models trained on one type of text struggle with another.

## Concept: OVERFITTING AND DOMAIN SHIFT

## Materials
- `INSTRUCTOR-GUIDE.md` — Full session plan with pre-prepared domain text samples
- `BETWEEN-SESSION.md` — Between-session challenge
