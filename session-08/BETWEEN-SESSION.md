# Between Sessions 8 & 9

## Your Challenge

**Find an image that breaks the pipeline. Figure out which step failed.**

### Steps

1. Go to the Image Story Pipeline Space (your copy or the class version)
2. Upload different kinds of images and watch what happens:
   - A photo of something obvious (a dog, a sunset)
   - A photo that's ambiguous or hard to describe
   - A meme or image with text
   - Abstract art or a pattern
   - A very dark or blurry photo
3. For your best "broken" result, write down:
   - What the image actually shows
   - What the caption said
   - What the sentiment said
   - Which step went wrong — did the captioner describe it incorrectly, or did the sentiment model misread a correct caption?

### What to Notice

- How often does the captioner get it right?
- When it's wrong, is it completely wrong or just slightly off?
- Does a wrong caption always lead to a wrong sentiment? Or can the sentiment model still get it right by accident?

### Bring It Back

Next session, be ready to show your most interesting broken result and explain where the pipeline failed.

## Notebook

Finish the experiments in the Session 8 notebook:
- Upload at least 3 different images and run the pipeline on each
- Fill in the error tracking table in Experiment 3
- Try the "corrected caption" test — does fixing the caption change the sentiment?

## GitHub

If you haven't uploaded a notebook yet, try it this week. Your `my-ai-portfolio` repo should be growing!
