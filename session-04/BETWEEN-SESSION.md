# Between Sessions: Sentiment Showdown Challenge

## Your Mission

Duplicate the Sentiment Showdown Space to your own Hugging Face profile.

Then try one (or both!) of these:

### Challenge 1: Add Another Model
Find a fourth sentiment model on the Hugging Face Hub and add it to the comparison. Search for "sentiment" on https://huggingface.co/models and pick one that looks interesting.

Hint: You'll need to add another `pipeline(...)` line and another output box in Gradio.

### Challenge 2: Find Maximum Disagreement
Feed the Space different inputs and try to find a sentence where **all three models disagree** as much as possible. Screenshot your best find and bring it to the next session.

### Questions to Think About
- Which model do you trust the most? Why?
- Are there types of text where one model is clearly better than the others?
- If you had to pick just ONE model for a real project, how would you decide?
