# Between Sessions: Text Playground Challenge

## Your Mission

Duplicate the Text Playground Space to your own Hugging Face profile.

Then try this:

### Challenge: Find the Best Settings

Pick **2 or 3 different writing tasks** from this list (or invent your own):

- A scary story opening
- A formal email to a teacher
- A funny random story
- A poem about pizza
- A movie trailer voiceover
- A text message to a friend
- A weather report

For each task:
1. Use the **same prompt** and experiment with the sliders
2. Write down the settings that worked best (temperature, top-p, max length)
3. Save your favorite output

### Bring to Next Session
Your "best settings recipe card" — what task, what settings, what output you got.

### Bonus
Try the **same settings** on two very different prompts. Do good settings for one task work for another?

## Notebook

Finish the experiments in the Session 5 notebook:
- Fill in the "settings recipe cards" table with your best settings for each task
- Try Experiment 2 (same settings, different prompts) and Experiment 3 (extreme settings)
- Write down any surprising results

## GitHub

If you haven't uploaded a notebook to your `my-ai-portfolio` repo yet, try it this week:
1. Go to your repo on github.com
2. Click **Add file** > **Upload files**
3. Drag in a notebook you've saved from Colab
4. Write a short commit message and click **Commit changes**
