# Between Sessions 3 & 4

## Your Challenge

**Find an input that breaks your Space — then ask an AI to fix it.**

### Steps

1. Open your Space (the Silly Phrase Finder or Emotion Detector — whichever you have)
2. Try to find an input that gives a bad or weird result
3. Describe the problem to Claude or ChatGPT using the CLEAR framework:
   - **C**ontext: What does your Space do?
   - **L**anguage: What's it built with? (Python, Gradio, Transformers)
   - **E**xplain: What goes wrong? What input causes the problem?
   - **A**sk: What do you want the AI to do?
   - **R**equirements: Any specific constraints? (Must work on free CPU, must stay simple)
4. Try applying the AI's suggestion to your Space

### What to Notice

- Did the AI understand your problem?
- Did the fix actually work?
- Did you need to ask follow-up questions?

### Bring It Back

Next session, be ready to share: what broke, what you asked, and whether the fix worked.
