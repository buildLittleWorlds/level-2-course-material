# Google Colab

## What Is It?

Google Colab — short for Google Colaboratory — is a free tool that lets you write and run Python code in your web browser. You can find it at [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).

The key idea: you don't install anything. No downloading Python, no configuring your computer, no worrying about whether you have a Mac or a PC or a Chromebook. You open a link, and you're coding. Everything runs on Google's computers in the cloud, and you see the results in your browser.

Colab uses something called a **notebook**. A notebook is a document that mixes regular text (explanations, instructions, questions) with blocks of code you can run. You read a bit, run a code block, see what happens, read the next bit, run the next block. It's like a lab worksheet that actually does things.

## Why Is It Valuable?

Running AI models takes computing power — sometimes a lot of it. If you tried to run some of these models on a regular laptop, it might take forever or just crash. Colab gives you access to Google's servers for free, including GPUs (specialized chips that are really good at the math AI models need). This means you can experiment with real AI models without buying expensive hardware.

Colab is also valuable because it removes the biggest barrier to learning to code: setup. Anyone who has tried to install Python, manage packages, and fix mysterious error messages knows that getting started is often harder than the actual coding. Colab skips all of that. Click a link, start coding.

And because Colab notebooks live in your Google Drive, they're always backed up, always accessible from any computer, and easy to share. If you want to show someone what you built, you just send them a link.

## Why Is It Worth Learning?

Notebooks aren't just a teaching tool — they're how real data science and AI work gets done. Researchers at universities write their experiments in notebooks. Data scientists at companies use notebooks to explore data and build models. When someone publishes a new AI paper, they often release a Colab notebook so other people can reproduce their results.

By learning to use Colab now, you're picking up a skill that translates directly into college coursework, internships, and professional work. The interface you'll use in this course is the same interface used by engineers at Google, researchers at MIT, and data analysts at startups.

In this course, every session has a companion Colab notebook. These notebooks are where you'll experiment on your own — changing parameters, testing different inputs, and breaking things on purpose to see what happens. The notebooks are designed to be exploratory. There's no single right answer. The goal is to try things and notice what changes.

## How Important Is It to the AI Community?

Colab has had a massive impact on making AI accessible to people who aren't professional engineers. Here are a few ways it matters:

It democratized AI experimentation. Before Colab, running a machine learning model required either an expensive computer with a good GPU or a paid cloud computing account. Colab gave everyone free access to the same kind of hardware. This opened the door for students, hobbyists, and researchers in countries where computing resources are expensive or scarce.

It became the default way to share reproducible AI work. When someone builds something cool with AI and wants others to try it, the standard move is to publish a Colab notebook. "Open in Colab" buttons appear on GitHub repos, research papers, tutorials, and blog posts across the internet. You'll see these buttons in our course materials too.

It's the on-ramp for thousands of AI learners. Most popular AI courses and tutorials — from fast.ai to Stanford's CS courses to YouTube tutorials — use Colab as their recommended environment. When you learn to use Colab, you unlock access to a huge library of learning resources.

## A Bit of History

Google Colab launched in 2017 as an internal tool at Google's AI research division. Google researchers needed a way to collaborate on machine learning experiments without everyone having to set up identical computing environments. The notebook format — borrowed from an older open-source project called Jupyter — turned out to be perfect for this.

Google quickly realized the tool was useful beyond their own labs and made it publicly available in 2018. The timing was right: interest in AI and machine learning was exploding, and there were more people who wanted to learn than there were easy ways to get started. Colab filled that gap.

Over the years, Google has expanded Colab's free tier to include GPU access, added features like AI-assisted code completion, and integrated it deeply with Google Drive. There's a paid tier (Colab Pro) for people who need more computing power, but the free version is more than enough for what we'll be doing.

## Getting Started

If you have a Google account (Gmail, Google Classroom, etc.), you already have access to Colab. There's no separate sign-up.

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account if you aren't already
3. That's it — you're in

In this course, you won't need to create notebooks from scratch. Each session has a pre-made notebook with a link that opens directly in Colab. You'll click the link, and the notebook will appear ready to go. Your job is to read the instructions, run the code cells (by clicking the play button on each one), and experiment with changes.

One important thing: when you open a course notebook, Colab will ask if you want to save a copy to your Drive. Say yes. That way your experiments and changes are saved in your own Google Drive, and you can always go back to them.
