# GitHub

## What Is It?

GitHub is a website — [github.com](https://github.com) — where people store, share, and collaborate on code. It's the largest platform of its kind in the world, home to hundreds of millions of projects ranging from tiny personal scripts to the source code of major software used by billions of people.

At its core, GitHub is built on a tool called **Git**, which tracks every change made to a set of files. Imagine a version of Google Docs, but for code — where you can see every edit anyone ever made, go back to any previous version, and work on different ideas without messing up what already works. GitHub takes that power and puts it on the web, with a profile page, social features, and a way to share your work publicly.

In this course, GitHub plays two roles. First, it's where all of our course materials live — the notebooks, the code for each session's Space, the slides. When you click a "Open in Colab" link, it's actually pulling the notebook file from our GitHub repository. Second, as the course goes on, you'll start using GitHub yourself to manage your own projects.

## Why Is It Valuable?

GitHub solves a problem that everyone who writes code eventually runs into: keeping track of what you changed, when you changed it, and why. Without version control, coding projects turn into a mess of files named things like `app_final.py`, `app_final_v2.py`, `app_ACTUALLY_final.py`. Git (and GitHub) eliminates that chaos.

But GitHub is more than a filing system. It's also a **portfolio**. Your GitHub profile shows the projects you've built, the code you've written, and how active you are. For anyone interested in tech, data science, AI, or software — whether you're applying to college, an internship, or a job — a GitHub profile with real projects on it is one of the most valuable things you can have. It's proof that you can build things, not just talk about them.

GitHub is also where open-source software happens. Open-source means the code is public — anyone can read it, use it, suggest improvements, or build on top of it. Most of the AI tools we use in this course (the `transformers` library, Gradio, even many of the models on Hugging Face) are open-source projects hosted on GitHub.

## Why Is It Worth Learning?

Learning GitHub early gives you a real advantage. Here's why:

It's a universal skill in tech. Whether you end up in computer science, data science, biology research, digital humanities, or any field that touches code or data, you'll encounter Git and GitHub. Learning it now means you won't have to scramble to pick it up later when the stakes are higher.

It teaches you to work like a professional. In the real world, nobody codes alone. Teams use GitHub to coordinate: one person works on the user interface, another works on the data processing, and GitHub keeps everything organized. Even in this course, when you duplicate and customize a Space, you're practicing a simplified version of the same workflow that professional teams use every day.

It's your public record. Every Space you build, every experiment you run, every project you complete — if it's on GitHub, it's visible. Over time, your GitHub profile becomes a living portfolio that grows with you.

## How Important Is It to the AI Community?

GitHub is the backbone of open-source AI development. Here's what that looks like in practice:

Almost every major AI project lives on GitHub. The code for PyTorch (the most popular AI framework), Hugging Face's `transformers` library, Gradio, and thousands of other tools — it's all on GitHub. When researchers release a new model or technique, the code almost always ends up in a GitHub repository.

It's how AI research becomes AI practice. A researcher publishes a paper. They post the code on GitHub. Other researchers and engineers read the code, reproduce the results, improve on them, and share their improvements back. This cycle — enabled by GitHub — is a huge part of why AI has advanced so quickly in recent years.

GitHub is also where community happens. People file bug reports, suggest features, ask questions, and contribute code to projects they care about. Some of the most important contributions to major AI tools have come from individual developers who spotted a problem, fixed it, and submitted the fix through GitHub.

## A Bit of History

Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds — the same person who created the Linux operating system. He needed a fast, reliable way to manage the thousands of contributions that developers around the world were making to Linux. The tool he built, Git, turned out to be useful for far more than just Linux.

GitHub launched in 2008 as a website built on top of Git. It added a visual interface, user profiles, and collaboration features that made Git accessible to people who didn't want to live in the command line. GitHub grew rapidly. By the mid-2010s it had become the default home for open-source software.

In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion — a sign of just how central the platform had become to software development worldwide. Since then, GitHub has continued to grow and has added features like GitHub Copilot (an AI coding assistant) and GitHub Actions (automated workflows). The platform now hosts over 200 million repositories.

## Getting Started

Creating a GitHub account is free:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **Sign up**
3. Enter your email, create a password, and choose a username
4. Your username becomes your profile URL (e.g., `github.com/yourusername`), so pick something clean and professional — this could end up on a college application or a résumé someday

You don't need to know Git commands to get started. In the early sessions of this course, we'll interact with GitHub mostly through the web interface — clicking buttons, not typing commands. As the course progresses, you'll learn more about how Git works under the hood, but there's no rush. The web interface is plenty for now.

One thing to know: GitHub has a generous free tier. Everything we do in this course is completely free. You get unlimited public repositories, which means unlimited projects that anyone can see. There's a paid tier for private repositories and advanced features, but you won't need it.
