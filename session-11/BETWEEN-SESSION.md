# Between Sessions 11 & 12

## Final Polish Before Demo Day

This is it — next session is demo day. Here's how to prepare.

### Fix One Thing

Look at the feedback you got from your classmates. Pick the **one suggestion** that would make the biggest difference. Fix it.

Common quick fixes:
- Better title or description
- Add 1-2 more example inputs
- Improve how the output is displayed
- Fix an input that causes an error

### Practice Your Demo

You'll have 5-7 minutes. Practice out loud — to yourself, a parent, a sibling, your cat. Cover:

1. **What it does** — one sentence
2. **Live demo** — show it working (have your inputs ready!)
3. **What model you used** — and why you picked it
4. **What went wrong** — the hardest part, the thing that broke
5. **What you'd improve** — if you had more time

### Wake Up Your Space

If you haven't visited your Space in a few days, open the URL so it wakes up. Free Spaces go to sleep after a while, and the first load takes a minute.

### Bring It Back

Next session: your Space, your story, your demo. You built something real that lives on the internet. Show it off.

## Notebook

Fix both debug challenges if you haven't already. Update your Space's README.

## GitHub

Update any files in your repo that need fixing. Practice: edit a file directly on github.com.
