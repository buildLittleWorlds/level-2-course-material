### Spaces Built

| # | Space Name | URL | What It Does | Session Built |
|---|-----------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Silly Phrase Finder | [link] | Finds the silliest phrase in a passage using zero-shot classification | 1 |
| 2 | Emotion Detector | [link] | Detects emotions in text using a model trained on tweets | 2 |
| 3 | Silly Phrase Finder (with cleaning) | [link] | Session 1 Space + input preprocessing | 3 |
| 4 | Sentiment Showdown | [link] | Compares 3 sentiment models on the same input | 4 |
| 5 | Text Playground | [link] | Text generation with temperature/top-p/length sliders | 5 |
| 6 | Bias Tester | [link] | Tests paired sentences for model bias | 7 |
| 7 | Image Story Pipeline | [link] | Chains image captioning + sentiment analysis | 8 |
| 8 | [Final Project Name] | [link] | [description] | 10-12 |

*Note: Not all students will have built every Space. Class Spaces were instructor-led. Individual Spaces start at Session 10.*

### ML Concepts Covered

| # | Concept | How They Learned It |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | INPUT → MODEL → OUTPUT | Deployed first HF Space from scratch |
| 2 | Training Data & Representation | Swapped models, compared outputs |
| 3 | Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering | Fed adversarial inputs, built preprocessing |
| 4 | Model Evaluation | Ran 3 models side by side |
| 5 | Hyperparameters | Added sliders to control generation |
| 6 | Overfitting & Domain Shift | Tested same model on different text types |
| 7 | Bias in AI | Tested paired sentences for unfair differences |
| 8 | Multi-Model Systems & Error Cascades | Chained captioning + sentiment models |
| 9 | Prompt Engineering & Human-AI Interaction | Redesigned a Space for a real audience |
| 10 | Supervised Learning & Task Design | Built a Space from scratch with a chosen model |
