# Session 12: Demo Day

**Concept:** REFLECTION AND PORTFOLIO
**Space:** No new Space — student presentations and portfolio compilation
**Pre-session prep:** Wake ALL student Spaces 30+ minutes before session. Load each Space URL in a browser tab. Have screenshots of each Space as backup in case any fail to load. Prepare the portfolio template (see `portfolio-template.md`).

---

## Time Breakdown (2 hours)

### 0:00–0:10 — Setup and Tech Check

Open each student's Space URL in tabs. Quick check:
- Does each Space load?
- Is the student ready to present?

**If a Space won't load:**
- Check if it's still building (Files tab → check build log)
- If the Space was deleted or broken, use a screenshot and let the student talk through what it did
- Don't let a tech issue derail the session — the story matters more than a live demo

**Order of presentations:** Let students volunteer, or go in reverse alphabetical order (so the same students don't always go first/last). Have the order ready before session starts.

**Say:** "Tonight is your night. Each of you built something that lives on the internet — a real AI tool with a real URL. Let's see what you made."

### 0:10–1:20 — Student Presentations

5-7 minutes per student. With 5-6 students, this takes 25-42 minutes, leaving buffer for transitions and group testing.

**Presentation format (share this on screen):**

```
1. WHAT IT DOES (30 seconds)
   - One sentence: what does your Space do and who is it for?

2. LIVE DEMO (2 minutes)
   - Show it working with 2-3 inputs
   - Show one input where it works great
   - Show one input where it struggles

3. UNDER THE HOOD (1 minute)
   - What model did you use? Why that one?
   - What Gradio pattern did you use?

4. THE HARD PART (1-2 minutes)
   - What broke? What was the hardest problem?
   - How did you fix it (or work around it)?

5. WHAT'S NEXT (30 seconds)
   - If you had another month, what would you add or change?
```

**After each presentation:**
- Group tries the Space with their own inputs (1-2 minutes)
- One round of applause (seriously — they built this)
- Instructor highlights one specific thing they did well

**Instructor notes during presentations:**
- Write down each student's Space URL and one highlight for the portfolio
- Note any concepts the student demonstrates understanding of
- If a student is nervous, prompt them: "Tell us about that model — why did you pick it?"
- If a student finishes early, ask: "What was the most surprising thing you learned?"

### 1:20–1:40 — Reflection

Group discussion. Go around the room (screen) for each question.

**Reflection questions:**

1. **"What concept surprised you most?"**
   - Prompt: "We covered 10 concepts — from INPUT→MODEL→OUTPUT all the way to building from scratch. Which one changed how you think about AI?"

2. **"What was the hardest thing you built?"**
   - Prompt: "Not just code — the hardest decision, the hardest bug, the hardest design choice."

3. **"How has your understanding of AI changed since Session 1?"**
   - Prompt: "Remember the first night? We looked at 4 Spaces and you didn't know how any of them worked. What do you know now?"

4. **"What would you build next?"**
   - Prompt: "If you had unlimited time and any model on the Hub, what Space would you create?"

**The 10 concepts — quick recap:**

| # | Concept | Session | How They Learned It |
|---|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | INPUT → MODEL → OUTPUT | 1 | Built their first Space |
| 2 | Training Data & Representation | 2 | Swapped models, got different answers |
| 3 | Data Cleaning | 3 | Broke the Space on purpose, then fixed it |
| 4 | Model Evaluation | 4 | Ran 3 models on the same input |
| 5 | Hyperparameters | 5 | Added sliders, saw output change |
| 6 | Overfitting & Domain Shift | 6 | Same model, different text types |
| 7 | Bias in AI | 7 | Paired sentences, different scores |
| 8 | Multi-Model Systems | 8 | Chained image captioning + sentiment |
| 9 | Prompt Engineering & UX | 9 | Redesigned a Space for a real audience |
| 10 | Supervised Learning & Task Design | 10 | Built from scratch, chose their own model |

**Say:** "You didn't learn these from a textbook. You learned them by running into them. That's how real practitioners learn too."

### 1:30–1:40 — Reflection Notebook

Share the Colab notebook link in the Zoom chat. Students open it and fill in their portfolio and reflections.

**What they do:**
- Fill in the portfolio table (HF profile, GitHub profile, Spaces they built)
- Answer the reflection questions (concept that surprised them, hardest part, what they'd do next)
- Check the GitHub portfolio checklist

**Instructor role:** Help students remember their Space URLs. Screen-share each student's HF profile page so they can see all their Spaces listed. This is a quiet, reflective moment — give it space.

**If time is short:** Just have them fill in the portfolio table. The reflection questions can be done after the session.

### 1:40–1:55 — Portfolio Consolidation

Help each student compile their portfolio. Use the portfolio template (`portfolio-template.md`).

**What to collect for each student:**
1. Their HF profile URL (huggingface.co/username)
2. URLs for every Space they built or forked
3. A one-sentence description of their final project
4. Which concept they found most interesting

**How to compile:**
- Screen-share the portfolio template
- Fill it in together for each student (takes ~2 minutes per student)
- Save as a PDF or share the markdown with Bing as the deliverable

**Deliverable for Bing:** One document per student with their Space URLs, descriptions, and reflection. This is the consolidated portfolio the program director wants.

**If time is short:** At minimum, collect the Space URLs and one-sentence descriptions. The reflection can be added later.

### 1:55–2:00 — Wrap-Up

**Say:**
- "You each have public URLs that anyone in the world can visit. That's your portfolio."
- "You understand 10 real ML concepts — not because someone lectured you, but because you built things and hit problems."
- "The next time someone shows you an AI tool, you'll know what's happening under the hood: what goes in, what model runs, what comes out, and what could go wrong."

Thank the students. Thank Bing (program director). Congratulate everyone.

**Final moment:** Open each student's Space one more time on the shared screen. One URL per student, visible to the group. "These are yours."

## What Could Go Wrong

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Student's Space won't load (asleep/broken) | Have screenshots ready. Let them present from the screenshot and talk through what it did. |
| Student is too nervous to present | Offer to co-present: you share the screen and drive, they narrate. |
| Presentations run long | Gently time-keep. "That's great — let's save the rest for Q&A. Who's next?" |
| Presentations run short | Fill with group testing of the Space. "Let's all try it — give me an input!" |
| Student didn't finish their project | Celebrate what they DID build. Even a forked template with customized labels counts. |
| Portfolio compilation takes too long | Collect just the URLs and names during session. Fill in descriptions async. |
| Bing (program director) joins the session | Great! Let students present directly to the stakeholder. Adjust nothing — this is what they prepared for. |
| Emotional moment (student proud/upset) | Let it breathe. These kids built something real. That matters. |
