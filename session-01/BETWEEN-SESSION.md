# Between Sessions 1 & 2

## Your Challenge

**Duplicate the Silly Phrase Finder and change the labels.**

### Steps

1. Go to [profplate/silly-phrase-finder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/profplate/silly-phrase-finder) (or your own if you built one)
2. Click the **three dots menu** (⋯) in the top right → **Duplicate this Space**
3. It will create a copy under your account
4. Open the **Files** tab → click on `app.py`
5. Find the line that says:
   ```python
   labels = ["silly and ridiculous", "serious and important", "ordinary and boring"]
   ```
6. Change those labels to anything you want! Ideas:
   - `["scariest", "funniest", "most boring"]`
   - `["most dramatic", "most chill", "most confusing"]`
   - `["sounds like a villain", "sounds like a hero", "sounds like a side character"]`
7. Commit the change and wait for the Space to rebuild

### What to Notice

- Did the model "understand" your new labels?
- Which labels work well? Which ones confuse the model?
- Try the same text with different label sets — does the winner change?

### Bring It Back

Next session, be ready to share: what labels did you try, and what surprised you?
