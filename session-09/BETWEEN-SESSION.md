## The Real Test

Have someone **outside the class** try your Space.

### How to Do It

1. Send them your Space URL (it's public on Hugging Face)
2. **Don't explain anything** — just say "try this and tell me what you think"
3. Watch (or ask) what happens:
   - Did they understand what to type?
   - Did they understand the output?
   - Did they get confused anywhere?

### What to Bring Back

Come to Session 10 ready to answer:

- **Who did you test it with?** (friend, parent, sibling, teacher...)
- **What confused them?**
- **What would you change based on watching them use it?**

### Why This Matters

Professional AI developers do exactly this — it's called **user testing**. The model is only half the product. The other half is whether a real person can actually use it.
