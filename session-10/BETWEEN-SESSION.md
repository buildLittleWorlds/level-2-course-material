# Between Sessions 10 → 11

## Get Your Space Working

This is the most important between-session work of the whole course. Your Space is YOUR project — the thing you'll present on Demo Day (Session 12).

### Checklist

- [ ] **Does your Space run?** Visit the URL. Does it load without errors?
- [ ] **Do your examples work?** Click each example input. Do you get reasonable output?
- [ ] **Is the title clear?** Would someone who doesn't know AI understand what this does?
- [ ] **Is the description helpful?** Does it explain who this is for and what it does?
- [ ] **Try 5 weird inputs.** What happens with emoji? Very long text? Empty input? Gibberish?

### If Your Space Is Broken

1. Open your Space on Hugging Face
2. Click the "Files" tab
3. Open `app.py`
4. Check for typos or missing imports
5. Look at the "Logs" tab for error messages
6. If you're stuck, bring the error message to Session 11 — we'll fix it together

### If Your Space Works

Try to make it better:
- Add one more example
- Improve the output formatting
- Test it with a friend and see what confuses them

### Bring to Session 11

- Your working Space URL
- One thing you're proud of
- One thing you want to improve
