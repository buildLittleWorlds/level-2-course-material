# Between Sessions 7 & 8

## Your Challenge

**Design 5 paired-sentence tests and document what you find.**

### Steps

1. Go to the Bias Tester Space (your copy or the class version)
2. Come up with 5 pairs of sentences where you change only one thing:
   - Swap a name (e.g., Emily vs. Aisha)
   - Swap a pronoun (he/she/they)
   - Swap a role or job title (doctor/nurse, CEO/assistant)
   - Swap an age reference (young/old)
   - Anything else you're curious about
3. For each pair, write down:
   - The two sentences
   - What the model predicted for each
   - Whether the results were the same or different

### What to Notice

- Did any results surprise you?
- Can you find a pattern in which swaps cause the biggest differences?
- Were there any pairs where you expected bias but didn't find it?

### Bring It Back

Next session, be ready to share your most surprising finding. We'll talk about what this means for AI systems that make real decisions about people.

## Notebook

Finish the experiments in the Session 7 notebook:
- Fill in all 5 of your own test pairs in Experiment 1
- Run Experiment 2 (find the biggest bias gap)
- Try at least one new category of swap in Experiment 3

If you haven't uploaded a notebook to your `my-ai-portfolio` repo yet, try it this week. You should have at least one notebook in your repo by now!
